# COVID-Analyses
A collection of my scripts and work with COVID-19 open data.  

## Data sources
Data is NOT provided with the repository, and must be downloaded.  
SRAG data is available in the [Ministry of Health of Brazil opendata website] (https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/).  
The 2020 csv (INFLUD-day-month-2020.csv) can be downloaded [here] (https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset/bd-srag-2020).  
The 2021 csv (INFLUD-day-month-2021.csv) can be downloaded [here] (https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset/bd-srag-2021).
Data from [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) was also used (files 'time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv' and 'time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv').  
  
These files are supposed to be in the folder 'data'.  
  
R package [coronabr] (https://github.com/liibre/coronabr) was also used.
